Welcome to the final project of Winter 2017 Graphic Design led by Karin. 

## Emoji Usage
Due to licensing issues for my original idea, which was focused entirely on replacing tracked faces through the code with memes, I have resorted to using a set of Emojis. The meme (viral images that invoke humour/play) are difficult to determine if they are public domain pieces or copyrighted to their original content. For example, a meme that is derived from a TV series will retain the copyright of the TV show, not the meme. This means I will need to require permission from all existing parties that hold copyright for each meme I plan on using.

The emojis I have selected are free to use for any digital project, under a free culture Creative Commons License (CC-BY 4.0). Proper attribution (link back) is required, however, for the rights to use our emoji in digital projects. You will find the attribution link at the bottom of the website. The emojis can be found here (along with licensing information): http://emojione.com/licensing/
