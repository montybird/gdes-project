Welcome to the final project of Winter 2017 Graphic Design led by Karin. 

## Licensing
Due to licensing issues for my original idea, which was focused entirely on replacing tracked faces through the code with memes, I have resorted to using a set of free to use emojis. Memes (viral images that invoke humour/play) are difficult to determine if they are public domain pieces or copyrighted to their original content. For example, a meme from a TV series will retain the copyright of the TV show, and not the author of the meme. This makes it quite difficult to obtain clear permission for legal usage.

The emojis I have selected are free to use for any digital project, under a free culture Creative Commons License (CC-BY 4.0). You will find the attribution link at the bottom of the website. The emojis can be found here (along with licensing information): http://emojione.com/licensing/

I am using TrackingJS for the camera and tracking features. The code is open source and free to use (https://github.com/eduardolundgren/tracking.js/). I am also using TypedJS for the typewriter animation which is also open source and free to use https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/.
